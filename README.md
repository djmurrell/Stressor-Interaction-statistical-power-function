# Stressor-Interaction-statistical-power-function

This project simulates data with user inputed expected values for biological responses in the classical factorial experimental set up to investigate the type of interaction between two stressors. It should be used as guidance for setting up real experiments where the user chooses plausible values for treatment means and standard deviations, and the function returns an estimate of the statistical power to reject the null model prediction for the interaction.

The user should also read the multiplestressR manual pages.
